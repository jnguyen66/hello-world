My first respository test

Hi I am a UCLA Graduate who majored in Economics, and now works in Commercial Real Estate. I have been atttracted to the idea of computer programming for years. I started fiddling around on code academy, and progressively got more serious as i began taking courses online at Rice University, until i finally made up my mind, and decided to go to get an associates degree in programming. Hoping that maybe this would be a great opportunity for me to get my foot in the door. We have yet to see that chapter of my life yet, but my fingers are crossed.
